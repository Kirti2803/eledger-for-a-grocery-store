<h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
<h3>E-LEDGER is a web based personalized system that has been designed for a grocery store. Now a days, since most of the things are being digitalized in the era of the 21st century, we have developed a database system for a grocery shopkeeper. This is an easier way for the shopkeepers to monitor their daily transactions with the customers. Grocery shopkeepers can now easily maintain their records through this database. As we know, shopkeepers used to keep the record of customers who have purchased a grocery item on loan in a piece of paper or in their own diaries. Now, through this personalized system, the shopkeepers can keep a record of such things in a computer, which makes it easier for them to maintain records and access them whenever required. Only the grocery shopkeeper can login and register users as convenient to him/her. So all together, this personalized database system can also be thought of as a digital personalized diary for a shopkeeper. This works better than the pen-paper system of maintaining records.
The existing system carries more time to do a piece of work. For this reason the online system is implemented. In this project security is also maintained i.e. only the shopkeeper can login and modify as per his needs.
